# Important terms in OS 

## 🎂Processes and CPU scheduling 
### 🧑‍🍳Processes 
Process is the execution of a program. \
Create a process: **fork()** \
Execute a process: **execve()** \
Let a process wait: **wait()** \
Terminate a process: **kill()** or **exit()** 

### 🔁Context Switches
- Switching context between two processes
- Take care of the first process before making the second process to work
- Expensive, overhead
- Interrupts
- Transition between kernel-mode and user-mode 

### 🧵Process vs. Threads 

### CPU Scheduling 
Scheduling has deciding as their job. They get to decide which task that may use the resource, i.e., determines order by which requests are serviced, using different ✨algorithms✨.

#### ✨Scheduling algorithms
**FIFO**
**Round Robind**
**Shortest Job First**

## Storage/Disk and File Systems 

## IPC
